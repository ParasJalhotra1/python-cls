It 's true, my drawings are hyper-realistic, but it is also true that you can find my style in each of them, my own way of translating reality. My drawings are not perfect, I'm never happy with the result, I often get angry because I can see a lot of flaws that I always hope to correct in the next work. However, limitations and imperfections represent the style and anyone who has a keen eye will always identify my drawings, without the need to look at the signature.
